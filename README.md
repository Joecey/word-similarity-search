# Word Similarity Search (Java 17) 
Word similarity search created with Java 17 to allow users to rank words or phrases based on a 50d vector dataset. 
This project allows users to provide a 50d vector dataset of word embeddings and a word/phrase they would like to parse.
From there, the program provides the highest ranked words based on similarity using an approach of the user's choosing. 
The following similarity algorithms include:
- Dot Product
- Euclidean Distance
- Cosine Distance
