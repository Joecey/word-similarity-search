# Word Similarity Search (Java 17)
Word similarity search created with **Java 17** to allow users to rank words or phrases based on a 50d vector dataset. 
This project allows users to provide a [**50d vector dataset of word embeddings**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 
and a word/phrase they would like to parse. From there, the program provides the highest ranked words based on similarity 
using an approach of the user's choosing.

## State-of-the-Art Features
1. **Bring your own weights:** Along with the default 50d dataset we provide, you are able to specify your own 50d
dataset for parsing and ranking
2. **Parse single words or sentences:** Parse a single word or an entire sentence, and the system will try to provide
the best result for you
3. 

The following similarity algorithms include:
- Dot Product
- Euclidean Distance
- Cosine Distance
